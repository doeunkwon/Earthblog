# ðŸŒŽ Earthblog

> A platform for activists.

### Motivation
I made Earthblog after watching the movie "Okja" directed by Bong Joon Ho. I felt like there was a lot of injustice happening in the world and many passionate people fighting against it. Clearly, Earthblog is just a personal project and I didn't deploy the site. But I wanted to play pretend and I asked myself 'if I had to use code to make the world a better place, what would I make?'. I decided that I would make a platform where people who are already prepared to fight for their beliefs could meet one another. Instead of chasing the gold, I'd be more useful providing the shovels. My answer to my question is Earthblog.
