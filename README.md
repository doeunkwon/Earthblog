# ðŸŒŽ Earthblog

> A platform for activists.

### Motivation
I made Earthblog after watching the movie "Okja" directed by Bong Joon Ho. I felt like there was a lot of injustice happening in the world and many passionate people willing to fight for what's right. Clearly, Earthblog is just a personal project and I didn't deploy the site. But I wanted to play pretend and I asked myself 'if I had to use code to make the world a better place, what would I make?'. I decided that I would build a platform where people who are already prepared to fight for their beliefs could meet one another. Instead of chasing the gold, I'd be more useful providing the shovels. My answer to my question is Earthblog.

### Description
People who visit the site can still read the blogs, but they can't post their own stuff. People who decide to stick around can register for an account. This way, if people like your blog, they can click on your @ and read all of your other blogs as well. The site offers the most basic 'social media platform' features. Users can create, read, update, and delete their blogs. And if they don't like the service anymore, they can delete their accounts.
